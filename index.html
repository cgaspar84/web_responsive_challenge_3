                <p>Welcome to Pokemon Sword and Shield, and your adventures in the new region of Galar</p>
                <p>This guide will cover the basics from the start of the game until the first gyms. I hipe it helps you
                    guide your first steps on your new adventure.</p>

            <section id="Postwick_and_Route_1" class="main-section">
                <header>Postwick and Route 1</header>
                <h2>Postwick</h2>
                <p>Once you get through the opening cutscenes, select your appearance, name, and all that jazz, you'll
                    start the game on the sofa of your house in Postwick. Hop runs in, tells you to grab your stuff,
                    then he'll wait for you to head outside.</p>
                <p>Head into your room at the other side of the house and pick up your rucksack and hat, have a quick
                    word with Mom, then leave through the front door. Take note of the erratic Wooloo by the fence —
                    you'll be back here shortly — and follow Hop down the path towards his house. Head inside, speak to
                    his Mom, then leave again and go down Route 1 towards Wedgehurst. You can't go in the tall grass yet
                    because you don't have any Pokemon, so head to the town where you'll greet Leon.</p>
                <h2>Choosing a starter</h2>
                <p>After meeting Leon, Hop's older brother and champion, head back to Postwick and now we get to pick
                    our starter</p>
                    <div class="encounter-container">
                <code>
                <ul>
                    <li id="grass"><span>Grookey</span>the grass type, high hp, physical attack, and defense</li>
                    <li id="water"><span>Sobble</span>the water, type, high special attack and speed</li>
                    <li id="fire"><span>Scorbunny</span>the fire type, high physical attack and speed</li>
                </ul>
                </code></div>
            </code>
                <h2>Slumberin Weald and Route 1</h2>
                <p>Head back up towards your house and the Wooloo will have finally broken through that pesky gate,
                    standing in the way of Wooloo's hopes and dreams. Pick the option to save Wooloo and head into the
                    forest, battling a few wild Pokemon along the way. Take this time to level up your starter a couple,
                    before heading to the end of the path.</p>
                <p>Surprise! Depending on whether you have Sword or Shield, you'll find Zacian or Zamazenta here, but
                    what has it done with the poor Wooloo?! You'll be thrown into a battle against the legendary best,
                    but you can't deal any damage to it. Try a few times and you'll be knocked unconscious, when Leon
                    will find and rescue you, along with finding Wooloo safe and sound.</p>
                <p>Head back up to your house and talk to Mom again to get some Poke Balls and dollar dollar bills
                    y'all, then head down to Route 1 where you'll be forced into the tall grass. Catch some Pokemon here
                    to flesh out your party and level up your 'mons, then proceed into Wedgehurst.</p>

            <section id="Wedgehurst_and_Route_2" class="main-section">
                <header>Wedgehurst and Route 2</header>
                <h2>Wedgehurst</h2>
                <p>When you reach Wedgehurst, cross the bridge and head to the right where you'll find Leon waiting for
                    you outside the Pokemon Research Lab. Go inside and you'll meet Sonia for the first time, then after
                    the cutscene, head back outside to meet Hop who will introduce you to the Pokemon Center. </p>
                <p>Explore the town and shops, then when you're ready to move forwards, Hop will tell you all about the
                    gym challenge. Follow the path down and you'll reach Route 2, where Leon gives you 20 more Poke
                    Balls.</p>
                <h2>Route 2</h2>
                <p>Just like on Route 1, use this time to battle some wild Pokemon and catch some more, because there's
                    a staggering amount of Pokemon available here. When you get through the first two sections of tall
                    grass, you'll face your first trainer battle against Youngster Jake.</p>

                <p>When you've beaten Hop, Leon will give you a letter of endorsement so you can enter the gym
                    challenge. Grab the Wishing Star off Hop so you can now Dynamax your Pokemon, then when you're done
                    speaking with Magnolia again, Hop will challenge you to a race to see who can catch the most Pokemon
                    on the way back to Wedgehurst.</p>
                <p>While you can spend time doing this, even if you run straight back and don't catch any, Hop will
                    still give you TM40 Swift as a gift. Head inside the train station, grab the Camping Gear off your
                    Mom, then jump on the train.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="Wild_Area_and_Motostoke" class="main-section">
                <header>Wild Area and Motostoke</header>
                <h2>Wild Area</h2>
                <p>Despite heading to Motostoke, a flock of Wooloo on the tracks forces the train you're on to stop
                    abruptly at the Wild Area. When in the station — if you played Pokemon Let's Go Pikachu or Eevee —
                    speak to the couple to the left of the door to the platform. They'll give you a special version of
                    Pikachu or Eevee depending on the version you played. What's so special, I hear you ask? They can be
                    Dynamaxed!</p>
                <p>Leave the station and you'll be in the Wild Area, where you can control the camera with the right
                    stick. Revolutionary! You don't need to do anything specific in the Wild Area right now, simply aim
                    to get to Motostoke at the other end.</p>
                <h2>Motostoke</h2>
                <p>When you get to Motostoke, head towards the Pokemon Center to find Sonia. She'll take you inside and
                    show you how league cards work, then afterwards, you can spend some time exploring the high street.
                    Make sure you check out the Battle Cafe and take on Cafe Master Dwight because you'll earn a reward
                    every time you fight him, although his lineup changes each time you face him.</p>
                <p>Afterwards, make sure you talk to the guy outside of the record store to get the Hi-Tech Earbuds –
                    these allow you to go into the options and adjust the volume of Background Music, Pokemon Cries, and
                    Sound Effects individually – then head to the end of the road to use the lift. Leon will interrupt
                    and give you an item dependent on which starter you picked, but then you can head up the lift and
                    into Motostoke Stadium. Not before speaking to Ball Guy, of course.</p>
                <p>Speak to Hop and enter the Motostoke Stadium, then get registered with the guy at the front desk.
                    Leave again and you'll be taken to the Budew Inn down the road, but don't go inside yet. Go west a
                    little further and speak to the two boys by a shipping crate with their mom.</p>
                <p>They've lost their Minccino and it's up to you to find it for them. All you know is it likes water,
                    so walk back along to the stadium and outside are two fountains. Approach the one on the left and
                    whistle to make Minccino come out of hiding. Head back to the boys for a reward, then go inside the
                    Budew Inn.</p>
                <p>After speaking with Sonia in the lobby, you'll be introduced to Team Yell for the first time, with
                    three successive battles against four Grunts, with the final fight being a duo battle alongside Hop.
                </p>
                <p>Take down all four trainers and Marnie, one of the challengers for the Gym Challenge will appear.
                    Team Yell are her rather eager fans, and she apologises on behalf of them. Speak to the receptionist
                    to jump to the next day.</p>
                <p>Walk over to the Motostoke Gym to watch the opening ceremony for the Gym Challenge, featuring Rose,
                    the Director. When it's done, Rose and Leon will come and talk to you, then as you leave, you'll
                    receive the Flying Taxi service as a gift which allows you to fly to any location you've visited
                    already. Walk left down the path to find Hop who insists on another battle.</p>
                <p>After you've beaten Hop, keep going left to find Route 3.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="Route_3_Galar_Mine_and_Route_4" class="main-section">
                <header>Route 3 Galar Mine and Route 4</header>
                <h2>Route 3</h2>
                <p>Enter Route 3 and you'll be greeted by a few trainers and a bunch more Pokemon to catch. Lass Rei is
                    first up. After Lass Rei, there's Schoolgirl Hannah further down the path. Finally, a little bit
                    further down the path is Schoolboy Marvin.</p>
                <p>Beat Marvin and head forward to find Sonia, who points out a building owned by the Director. Carry on
                    down the route after Sonia leaves and there's an optional path to your left, but Schoolgirl Kayleigh
                    stands in your way.</p>
                <p>Walk along the path and you'll find a berry tree, followed by TM37 Beat Up right at the end. Head
                    back and Postman Tad is patrolling the area. Keep going and you'll find Becca with her Pokemon Camp,
                    which you can enter and use if you wish. Further on is Schoolboy Peter before the entrance to the
                    mine. Walk up the hill to find the entrance to Galar Mine, with a friendly woman outside who will
                    heal your Pokemon up to full health.</p>

                <h2>Galar Mine</h2>
                <p>The mine is fairly straightforward, with a couple of items dotted around the place. The first trainer
                    you'll come across is Worker Keith.</p>
                <p>After defeating Worker Keith, head up the path that goes backwards and you'll find three Great Balls
                    on a ledge. Keep going and leave through the exit onto the path above the entrance, where you'll
                    find TM54 Rock Blast. Head back inside and further through the mine to find Worker Georgia. </p>
                <p>Follow the path past Worker Georgia to the end and you'll find TM26 Scary Face. Turn around and the
                    next trainer up is Worker Sandra. These workers aren't getting much work done. Finally, there's
                    Worker Russel slightly further on, guarding an item. Defeat him to get a pair of Heavy-Duty Boots
                    off the ground. Proceed toward the end of the mine and you'll find Bede waiting for you, ready for a
                    fight. </p>
                <p>Bede loves the Psychic-types. Take her on with your strongest Bug and/or Dark-types to stand the best
                    chance, as it's unlikely you'll have found any Ghost-types yet. When you've defeated Bede, leave via
                    the exit to reach Route 4. </p>

                <h2>Route 4</h2>
                <p>In the distance, you can see Turffield Stadium, but there's a bunch of fields, wild Pokemon, and
                    trainers in your way. This area is quite open so you can tackle the fields in whichever order you
                    please, but before that, make sure you check out Molly's camp on your left and the berry tree in
                    front of you. First up is Pokemon Breeder Jaime.</p>
                <p>Head into the field next to Pokemon Breeder Jaime and you'll find Poke Kid Shane, dressed up as a
                    Pikachu. There's a bunch of wild Pokemon you can catch here, but the next trainer you'll find is
                    Pokemon Breeder Bradley, on the path between two fields. After Bradley, Poke Kid Mia is in the next
                    field, dressed as an Eevee. At the other end of the same field guarding TM07 Pin Missile is Poke Kid
                    Rhys. Finally, Poke Kid Sunny is in the field to the west. hen you've done everything on Route 4,
                    head down the path to Turffield.</p>

                <header>Turtfield and Route 5</header>
                <h2>Turtfield</h2>
                <p>When you enter Turffield, Hop will be waiting for you by the Pokemon Centre. Chat with him and
                    Sonia's Yamper will appear. Follow Yamper along the path and eventually you'll find Sonia, wondering
                    about the pattern on the side of the hill. Talk with her and she'll give you Milo's league card, so
                    you can head down to the gym and start the challenge. Speak to the girl by the two pillars first
                    however, as she'll tell you about some buried treasure. This is the Turffield Riddle.</p>
                <h2>Turtfield Riddle</h2>
                <p>There's one crucial clue here, and that's the word "Grass". Each standing stone is connected to a
                    type, so you need to find the Grass-type standing stone and interact with it. From then, you need to
                    find the standing stone that reads the type Grass is strong against, followed by the stone which has
                    the type weak against the second type.</p>
                <p>In simpler words, you need to interact with the Grass stone first. That's the one on the lower level
                    just left of the flower shop.</p>
                <p>After that, interact with the Water stone. That one is the first right-turn as you walk down the
                    slope from the girl who told you the riddle.</p>
                <p>Finally, you want to find the Fire stone. This one is the furthest away, down the path past the Poke
                    Center, next to the river. Interact with it and your character will dig up the Expert Belt, which
                    boosts the power of supereffective moves. </p>
                <h2>Turtfield Gym</h2>
                <p>When you get to the gym, speak with Ball Guy to get a Friend Ball. If you caught a Galarian Meowth on
                    Route 4, you can trade it with a girl called Mattia in the gym lobby for a normal Meowth, so make
                    sure you do that. Afterwards, speak with the girl at the front to take on the Grass gym. We
                    recommend having Fire-type and/or Flying-type Pokemon at the top of your party as they're strongest
                    against Grass-types.</p>
                <p>The gist of the challenge here is that you need to herd all of the Wooloo towards the hay bales. It's
                    fairly straightforward, but roaming Yampers in each section will try to stop you. Defeat the
                    trainers in each section to make the Yampers behave and when you've got to the end, you'll be able
                    to take on Milo.</p>
                <p>After you've beaten Leah, head up the stairs to face off against Milo, the Grass-type gym leader. As
                    he's the first gym leader, he's not too difficult to defeat, but be prepared for him to Dynamax.</p>
                <p>After beating Milo, you'll earn the ability to catch Pokemon up to level 25, and you'll be given TM10
                    Magical Leaf. Leave the gym and head to Route 5, which is over the stone bridge in the corner of the
                    town.</p>

                <p>At the very start of Route 5, you'll come across a duo battle with Reporter Gillian and Cameraman
                    Cam.</p>
                <p>After beating this pushy pair, you'll find the Pokemon Nursery. This is essentially the Day Care from
                    previous games and you can leave two Pokemon with the woman standing outside. Go inside and speak to
                    the woman to obtain a Toxel, then leave and you'll find Pokemon Breeder Adrian down the path
                    opposite.</p>
                <p>A few steps further down the path is Pokemon Breeder Debra. Head into the open area and you'll find
                    some more wild Pokemon to catch, along with a berry tree. There's also a bloke with a camp at the
                    top, and Cook Stuart to fight wandering around. When exploring this area, make sure you look behind
                    the rock to the far right and grab TM31 Attract. When you're done, head back up the slope to the
                    enormous bridge where you'll find Team Yell tormenting some poor chap. After defeating both Grunts,
                    the bloke you helped will give you a Rotom Bike, which you can use by pressing + or - for some high
                    speed action. Head across the bridge — note there's a number of hidden items to find along here —
                    until you reach Hop, who wants another battle. Cross the bridge and you'll find another open area,
                    including another trainer or two. Head through the enormous archway and congratulations, you've made
                    it to Hulbury!</p>

                <h2>Hulbury</h2>
                <p>Welcome to Hulbury! Heal up at the Pokemon Center by the entrance then when you leave, you'll be
                    greeted by Rose and his assistant, Oleana. She tells you that Rose will be waiting for you in the
                    local seafood restaurant but first, you need to defeat Gym Leader Nessa in the Water-type gym.
                    Before that however, let's do a little exploring.</p>
                <p>Head down the stairs opposite the seafood restaurant and you'll find a woman looking for a Minccino,
                    offering a Cottonee in return. If you caught a Minccino previously, this is a trade worth doing.
                    There's also a lady at one of the market stalls selling various types of incense. They're not cheap,
                    but it's worth having a browse to see if any are applicable for your party.</p>
                <p>Head east and down the steps to the dock with a number of boats moored to find a Shell Bell, then
                    make your way towards the gym in the distance. You'll be reliably informed that Nessa is out at the
                    moment and tends to hang out by the lighthouse, so walk past the gym further east. Take the path
                    onto the pier to find five Net Balls, then head back up to the road and keep going east to find
                    Nessa chilling. Speak with her and she'll return to the gym so you can take on the challenge.</p>
                <h2>Hulbury Gym</h2>
                <p>Since this is the Water-type gym, the puzzle you have to solve to reach the end is based on valves to
                    change the flow of water. Kick things off by heading to the right and taking on Gym Trainer Julia.
                </p>
                <p>When you've beaten her lone Tympole, interact with the red valve to change the flow of water. Run
                    over the now-vacant red panel and interact with the yellow valve, then turn around and hit the red
                    one again. Now you can progress down the right-hand side.</p>
                <p>When you reach the top of the stairs, run forwards and take on Gym Trainer Heather before interacting
                    with any other valves.</p>
                <p>After you've beaten her, turn the yellow valve behind her, then run to the opposite side and use the
                    red one. That should free up the path across the top. Run all the way to the other side and take on
                    Gym Trainer Lynn.</p>
                <p>Now you want to head right to the bottom and interact with the yellow one, then go back up the way
                    you came and press the red one in the corner. Finally, cross the path to the only blue switch and
                    interact with that in order to free up the trio of blue jets at the top. Go down the stairs to the
                    central path and up to reach Gym Leader Nessa.</p>
                <p>Taking down Goldeen and Arrokuda isn't too difficult, but Drednaw is when Nessa will Dynamax. I'd
                    recommend switching out to one of your Pokemon that can simply absorb some hits while Drednaw is
                    Dynamaxed, then switching back to one of your favoured types like an Electric or Grass-type Pokemon
                    after the three turns are up.</p>
                <p>When you defeat Nessa, you gain the ability to catch Pokemon up to level 30, and you're given TM36
                    Whirlpool. Leave the gym and Oleana will meet you, telling you to hurry up to the seafood
                    restaurant. Go there and a brief cutscene will take place, which ends with Sonia being instructed to
                    go to Hammerlocke and find the vault. Afterwards, you'll be given TM79 Retaliate, and Hop will meet
                    you outside, saying next stop is back to Motostoke to take on the Fire-type gym.</p>
